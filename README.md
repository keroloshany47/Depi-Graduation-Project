## Data Preparation & Cleaning

### Handling Missing Values

- Identify and fill or remove null values in important columns.

### Data Formatting

- Convert `HireDate` to datetime format.
- Standardize categorical values (e.g., Yes/No to 1/0).

### Merging Datasets

- Use `EmployeeID` as the primary key to join relevant CSV files.

### Creating Calculated Columns

- `Employee Tenure = Current Year - Hire Year`  
- `Attrition Status = Binary classification for attrition analysis`
